;;Symbols are identifiers that are normally used to refer to something
(def failed-biznuses ["charlies" "malibu-inn"])

(comment
Every programming language allows association between a name with a value.
Big difference with Lisps, however, allow manipulation symbols as data.
This is used a lot in  macros.
Functions can return symbols and take them as arguments

 Destructuring Parameters
The basic idea behind destructuring is that it lets you concisely bind symbols to values within a collection. Let's look at a basic example
)

(defn first-biz
  "Return the first element of a collection"
  [[biz-a]] ; <- Notice that biz is within a vector
  biz-a)

(first-biz ["vees" "nobu" "kfc"])

;; Here's how you would accomplish the same thing without destructuring:
(defn other-first-biz
  [biz-collection]
  (first biz-collection))
(other-first-biz ["mcdonalds" "la salsa"])

(comment
That vector is like a huge sign held up to Clojure which says, "Hey! This function is going to receive a list or a vector or a set as an argument. Make my life easier by taking apart the argument's structure for me and associating meaningful names with different parts of the argument!")

(defn biz-chooser
  [[first-choice second-choice & unimportant-choices]]
  (println (str "Your first choice is: " first-choice))
  (println (str "Your second choice is: " second-choice))
  (println (str "We're ignoring the rest of your choices. "
                "Here they are in case remember them when you are at la salsa: "
                (clojure.string/join ", " unimportant-choices))))

(biz-chooser ["sandwich shop" "vees" "mcdonalds" "la salsa"])

(comment
  You can also destructure maps. In the same way that you tell Clojure to destructure a vector or list by providing a vector as a parameter, you destucture maps by providing a map as a parameter
  )

(defn print-biz-location
  [{lat :lat lng :lng}]
  (println (str "Biz lat: " lat))
  (println (str "Biz lng: " lng)))
(print-biz-location {:lat 28.22 :lng 81.33})

;; We often want to just take keywords and "break them out" of a map, so there's a shorter syntax for that:

;; Works the same as above.
(defn redirect-to
  [{:keys [lat lng]}]
  (println (str "Biz lat: " lat))
  (println (str "Lat lng: " lng)))

(comment
You can retain access to the original map argument by using the :as keyword. In the example below, the original map is accessed with biz-location)

;; Works the same as above.
(defn navigate-to-biz-location
  [{:keys [lat lng] :as biz-location}]
  (println (str "Biz lat: " lat))
  (println (str "Biz lng: " lng))
  (redirect-to biz-location)
  (println biz-location))

(navigate-to-biz-location {:lat 28.22 :lng 81.33 :azimuth 200})
(comment
  In general, you can think of destructuring as instructing Clojure how to associate symbols with values in a list, map, set, or vector.
  )

** Arity
Functions can also be overloaded by arity. This means that a different function body will run depending on the number of arguments passed to a function.

(defn multi-arity
  ;; 3-arity arguments and body
  ([first-arg second-arg third-arg]
     (do-things first-arg second-arg third-arg))
  ;; 2-arity arguments and body
  ([first-arg second-arg]
     (do-things first-arg second-arg))
  ;; 1-arity arguments and body
  ([first-arg]
     (do-things first-arg)))
)

(comment
** The function body
Your function body can contain any forms. Clojure automatically returns the last form evaluated)

;; ** Anonymous Functions
;; This looks a lot like defn, doesn't it?
(fn [param-list] (+ 1 1))
(def ham (fn [] (+ 1 1)))

;; Example
(def biz-ratings (map (fn [biz] {(keyword biz) (rand)}) ["walmart" "target" "sears"]))
(def biz-ratings (map #({(keyword %) (rand)}) ["walmart" "target" "sears"]))

(def break-down (map rate-them biznuzes))
