     :doc "Contains the control flow logic for the asynchronous aspects of the program.
   The control logic of the program is decoupled and isolated by using the core.async
   go channels.
   The various logical piecies of the processing system have channels that serve
   as connection to each piece.
   A convention of sending a vector container a keyword token message  pair is used
   when inserting data into the channel system.
   This pair of information is used by the the dispatcher to route the correct data to
   correct handling function." }
